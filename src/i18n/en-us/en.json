    "title": "About this Dashboard",
    "project_title": "The Project",
    "project_text": "Swiss Job Tracker is a labor market dashboard that publishes time series aggregated from large-scale online data. The dashboard results from a collaboration between the KOF Swiss Economic Institute of ETH Zurich, the University of Lausanne, and the private company x28 AG. The dashboard contains weekly data on the development of job postings published online in Switzerland. The time series allow monitoring the Swiss labor market in real time. They can be broken down by industry, broad occupation, and canton. Swiss Job Tracker was created as part of the project 'What Workers Want' within the Swiss National Science Foundation's (SNSF) National Research Program on \"Digital Transformation\" (NRP-77).",
    "partner_title": "The Project Partners",
    "partner_text": "x28 continuously collects job postings advertised online in Switzerland. The company crawls them from all major online job boards and from company websites. x28 also systematizes each job posting. These data form the raw material for the vacancy indices published on Swiss Job Tracker. Researchers at KOF Swiss Economic Institute at ETH Zurich and the University of Lausanne developed the necessary tools to aggregate and publish these vast data weekly.",
    "methodology_title": "Methodology",
    "methodology_text1": "Swiss Job Tracker provides indices that reveal the development of unique online job postings in Switzerland. The underlying data represent the near-universe of job postings in Switzerland. They cover both firm websites and all major Swiss job portals. These data are collected by x28 AG and cover at least 72% of all vacancies and at least 90% of all vacancies posted online in Switzerland.",
    "methodology_text2": "The indices are constructed from the raw vacancy data. Each week, we access this data via x28's API, remove duplicates as identified by x28, impute certain missing information, and account for the entry and exit of job portals. The aggregate index and the indices by occupation, industry, and cantons are then computed based on weekly growth rates of this cleaned data set (reference day: Friday).",
    "methodology_text3": "The time series are published weekly. Hence, in contrast to extant job indices and indicators of the state of the job market, the indices allow monitoring the state of the Swiss job market at a very high temporal frequency."
